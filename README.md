# Left-Leaning Red-Black BST

The LLRB BST is a 2-3 tree where the structure uses internal left leaning links to hold together 3 seperate nodes. 

## Overview

A BST is a data structure that can hold and maintain data that can be traversed with ease. 

## How it works

The tree is self-satisfies itself after every insert to ensure it follows the main rules of a LLRB BST.
The rules:
1. A node cannot have a black left child, and a red right child
2. A node cannot have a red left child, and a red left grandchild
3. A node cannot have both children be red
